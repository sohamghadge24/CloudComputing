         PRACTICAL 4
AIM : Capturing and analyzing network packets using Wireshark (Fundamentals) :
- Identification the live network - Capture Packets
- Analyze the captured packets
Capturing Packets
Capture traffic on your wireless network, click your wireless interface.
You can configure advanced features by clicking Capture > Options, but this isn’t necessary for now.
  As soon as you single-click on your network interface’s name, you can see how the packets are working in real time. Wireshark will capture all the packets going in and out of our systems.
Promiscuous mode is the mode in which you can see all the packets from other systems on the network and not only the packets send or received from your network adapter. Promiscuous mode is enabled by default. To check if this mode is enabled, go to Capture and Select Options. Under this window check, if the
27|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
     
         checkbox is selected and activated at the bottom of the window. The checkbox says “Enable promiscuous mode on all interfaces”.
 The red box button “STOP” on the top left side of the window can be clicked to stop the capturing of traffic on the network.
Color Coding
Different packets are seen highlighted in various different colors. This is Wireshark’s way of displaying traffic to help you easily identify the types of it. Default colors are:
Light Purple color for TCP traffic Light Blue color for UDP traffic
Black color identifies packets with errors – example these packets are
delivered in an unordered manner.
To check the color coding rules click on View and select Coloring Rules. These color coding rules can be customized and modified to fit your needs.
 28|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          Analyze the captured Packets:
First of all, click on a packet and select it. Now, you can scroll down to view all its details.
  29|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         Filters can also be created from here. Right-click on one of any details. From the menu select Apply as Filter drop-down menu so filter based on it can be created.
 Display filter command –
1. Display packets based on specific IP-address  ip.addr == 192.0.2.1
  30|Page
K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         2. Display packets which are coming from specific IP-address  ip.src == 192.168.1.3
 3. Display packets which are having specific IP-address destination  ip.dst == 192.168.1.1
 4. Display packets which are using http protocol  http
  31|Page
K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         5. Display packets which are using http request  http.request
 6. Display packets which are using TCP protocol  tcp
 7. Display packets having no error connecting to server  http.response.code==200
  32|Page
K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         8. Display packets having port number 80  tcp.port==80 || udp.port==80
 9. Display packets which that contains keyword facebook  tcp contains facebook

         PRACTICAL 5
Aim :- Analyze the packets provided in lab and solve the questions using Wireshark :
- What web server software is used by www.snopes.com?
- About what cell phone problem is the client concerned?
- According to Zillow, what instrument will Ryan learn to play? - How many web servers are running Apache?
1. What web server software issued by www.snopes.com?
Analysis – The domain name be found from host header so we will set host header column where we will see all domain name. Select any HTTP request and expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol then right click on Host header and then Apply as Column.
   34|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         Now we can see our host www.snopes.com in host column.
 Right click on the selected packet and then select Follow TCP stream.
Now we can see the webserver name in server header it is Microsoft IIS 5.0
  35|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          2. About what cell phone problem is the client concerned?
Analysis – Client talking about cell so we search for cell keyword in whole packets. We will use regular express for searching the cell keyword. Apply frame matches “(?!) cell”
  36|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         After applying the filter now, we will start to check every HTTP request. We noticed in the first HTTP request cell keyword is in URL and it was about cell phone charging issue.
 3. According to Zillow, what instrument will Ryan learn to play?
Analysis – As we did in the last challenge, we will apply a regular express filter for the Zillow keyword. Apply frame matched “(?!) zillow”
  37|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         After applying the filter, we found only one packet with the Zillow keyword
 Select the packet and expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol tab right click on it go to Protocol Preferences and check Allow subdissector to resemble TCP stream.
 Now go to file and select Export Objects > HTTP. It will save all objects from the packet.
 38|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          Click on save all.
 After saving all files in a directory and we found a swf file with name Zillow. After opening the flash file, we saw that Zillow was trying to learn saxophone.
 39|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          4. How many web servers are running Apache?
Analysis – The web server name can be retrieved from HTTP response header.
So will apply filter http. response and we can see all http response packets.
 Now we will set the server header as column select any packet and right click on it then select Apply as Column.
 40|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          Now can see the server column where all server name is showing.
  41|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
         Now we have to check how many Apache packets are there we can’t count manually for each packet so we will apply another filter http.server contains “Apache”
 After applying filter go to Statistics > Endpoints
It will show all connections
  42|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          Check the limit to display filter then it will show the actual Apache connections. Now there are showing 22 connections but will exclude 192.168.1.71 because it is client’s IP not a server IP so there are actual 21 Apache servers.
 43|Page K.M. AGRAWALCOLLEGE
    
          CONCLUSION: We have successfully analyzed the packets provided and solved the questions using wireshark.

- Analyzing email header
 FTK can filter or find files specific to e-mail clients and servers. You can configure these filters when you enter search parameters.
Because of Jim’s responses to a poor performance review, the CEO of Superior Bicycles,Martha Dax, suspects he might have obtained sensitive information about the company’s business model that he’s leaking to a competitor.
Martha asked her CIO, to have an IT employee copy the Outlook .pst file from
Jim Shu’s old computer to a USB drive.
To process this investigation, we need to examine the Jim_shu’s.pst file, locate the message, and export it for further analysis of its header to see how Jim might have received it.
